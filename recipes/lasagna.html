        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fair warning: once you've made this, going back to a frozen lasagna will be impossible. It is somewhat time consuming but not difficult. My house smells delectable every time I make it!</p>
        <p>The sweet Italian sausage and ground beef combo along with the sauce is very flavorful</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef
            <li>½ cup minced onion
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
            <li>½ cup water
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
            <li>12 lasagna noodles
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese
            <li>1 egg
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ul>
